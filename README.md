# MPI_SCATTER_GATHER_ALLGATHER

The objective of this project is to compare MPI scatter, gather and allgather functions with your
own scatter, gather and allgather functions. Write three different programs, these programs perform the
followings:
1. Program 1: Implements you own scatter(myscatter) function.
2. Program 2: Implements you own gather(mygatter) function.
3. Program 2: Implements you own allgather(myallgatter) function.
Within each program, collect the time it takes to execute both MPI functions and your functions. Run
the program with different number of processes: 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22 and 24. Plot the graph
(time vs # of processes) for each program.

Submission:
Submit a zip file containing:
1. A pdf file containing a detailed description of the design and the implementation of your functions,
the jumpshots(only for experiment with 6 processes and 16 processes) and the graph (time,#of
processes) for each program..
2. Your C/C++ code.
